### Submission Types
{style="color: #8E44AD "}

Timbre 2023 invites submissions in one of the following formats:

- **Regular submissions for oral presentation or poster**: up to 2 pages (500-1000 words), can be expanded to 5 pages upon acceptance. Authors should indicate the mode of presentation that best fits their contribution. Final presentation mode will be based on author request, reviews, and program constraints.

- **Sessions or tutorials**: up to 2 pages (500-1000 words). If accepted, authors must provide in addition a 250-word abstract to promote the session/ tutorial on the conference website. Sessions/ tutorials might include:
    - Pedagogy conversations
    - Professional development sessions
    - Lecture-demos for technological tools
    - Lecture-recitals (timbre in practice)
- **Work-in-progress submissions**: a 250-word abstract plus a list of questions raised and/ or currently being addressed by the work. Accepted abstracts will be included in the proceedings. 
    - We particularly encourage work-in-progress submissions from “newcomers” – masters or early-stage doctoral students without a supervisor who is part of the timbre community, especially from underrepresented groups.

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least two members of the program committee. Accepted regular submissions can be updated to a 5-page paper that will be included in the conference proceedings. Submissions must conform to the template that is available here (coming soon).

### Environmental Statement
{style="color: #8E44AD "}

The steering committee of the International Conference on Timbre and the Timbre 2023 local chairs are committed to lessening the environmental impact of the conference. We pledge to offset/ compensate for at least a portion of the carbon footprint generated as a result of the conference's activity (e.g., air travel, physical infrastructure) by investing a possible surplus of the budget in initiatives such as [Eden Reforestation Projects](https://www.edenprojects.org/) or [Co2 Compensate](https://www.co2compensate.org/home), or other similar schemes.
