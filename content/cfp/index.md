### Submission Types
{style="color: #8E44AD "}

Timbre 2023 invites submissions in one of the following formats:

- **Regular papers**

  - _Submission_: Abstracts up to 2 pages (500-1000 words)
  - _Contribution_: Original research, including case studies, position papers, and review papers
  - _Presentation_: Oral presentation or poster. Authors are encouraged to indicate in their abstracts the mode of presentation that best fits their contribution. Final presentation mode will be based on author request, reviews, and program constraints
  - _Camera-ready_: Accepted regular submissions can be expanded to 5 pages. The updated/expanded version will be included in the conference proceedings

- **Sessions or tutorials**

  - _Submission_: Abstracts up to 2 pages (500-1000 words)
  - _Contribution_: We encourage a broad range of contributions. Sessions/tutorials might include:
    - Pedagogy conversations
    - Professional development sessions
    - Lecture-demos for technological tools
    - Lecture-recitals (timbre in practice)
  - _Presentation_: Sessions/tutorials typically last 1-2 hours. Authors should indicate upon submission how long they plan their session/tutorial to last. Final duration of sessions/tutorials will depend on the program, trying to accommodate the requested duration and the program constraints
  - _Camera-ready_: Accepted sessions/tutorials may be expanded to 5 pages. The updated/expanded version will be included in the conference proceedings. Additionally, authors of accepted sessions/tutorials must provide a 250-word abstract to promote their session/tutorial on the conference website

- **Work-in-progress**
  - _Submission_: A 250-word abstract plus a list of questions raised and/or currently being addressed by the work
  - _Contribution_: Work-in-progress submissions are expected to contain thought-provoking ideas that can potentially incite discussion and stimulate cross-pollination between communities. We particularly encourage work-in-progress submissions from “newcomers” – masters or early-stage doctoral students without a supervisor who is part of the timbre community, especially from underrepresented groups
  - _Presentation_: Work-in-progress submissions will be presented as posters in a dedicated session
  - _Camera-ready_: Accepted work-in-progress abstracts can be updated but not be expanded beyond the 250-word limit (plus questions). The updated version will be included in the conference proceedings

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least two members of the program committee. Submissions must conform to the <a href="./doc/timbre2023_template.dotx" >template</a>.

Please contact the <a href="mailto:caetano@prism.cnrs.fr,zwallmar@uoregon.edu">Programme Chairs</a> should you have any questions.

### Environmental Statement
{style="color: #8E44AD "}

The steering committee of the International Conference on Timbre and the Timbre 2023 local chairs are committed to lessening the environmental impact of the conference. We pledge to offset/ compensate for at least a portion of the carbon footprint generated as a result of the conference's activity (e.g., air travel, physical infrastructure) by investing a possible surplus of the budget in initiatives such as [Eden Reforestation Projects](https://www.edenprojects.org/) or [Co2 Compensate](https://www.co2compensate.org/home), or other similar schemes.
