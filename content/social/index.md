### One hour between 18:30 and 20:30 Private hands-on ancient Greek lyre workshop

There is also a possibility to book a private hands-on ancient Greek lyre workshop. This one-hour workshop will begin by taking a closer look at the sound and aesthetics of a reconstructed ancient Greek lyre and on the music system of antiquity in general. It will proceed with a hands-on lyre playing of the “Epitaph of Seikilos”, the oldest complete melody (with lyrics) that survives today! This will demonstrate that this ancient musical instrument is much simpler to learn than a guitar or most of the other modern instruments which probably explains why it was used as a teaching tool for almost every child in ancient Greece.

- Cost per person 40€
