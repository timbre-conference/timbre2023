<!-- The 3rd International Conference on Timbre, will be held in Thessaloniki, Greece, 10–12 July 2023. It will be hosted by the School of Music Studies and the Sound and Music Technology Lab at the Artistotle University of Thessaloniki. -->

<!-- Timbre 2023 will include the first ever Summer School on Timbre and Orchestration, an initiative of the [ACTOR Partnership](https://www.actorproject.org/). The summer school will take place 8–12 July 2023. -->

The scientific discourse on timbre has been gaining momentum since the mid 2010s from audio acoustics and music cognition to sound design and artificial intelligence. Following the [Berlin Interdisciplinary Workshop on Timbre](http://www.timbre2017.tu-berlin.de/) (2017), the international conference [Timbre is a Many-Splendored Thing](https://www.mcgill.ca/timbre2018/) (2018), and the [2nd International Conference on Timbre](https://timbre2020.mus.auth.gr/) (2020), the goal of Timbre 2023 is to continue a tradition of triennial meetings around timbre. Establishing a periodic gathering will help forge more solid bonds among the members of the emerging cross-disciplinary community.

Here something about the structure of the scientific programme. And the summer school.
