Timbre poses multifaceted research questions across the scientific spectrum, from hearing and music to psychology and neuroscience, to acoustics and artificial intelligence. The triennial [International Conference on Timbre](https://timbreconference.org/) brings together a cross-disciplinary community of scholars, researchers, and practitioners interested in timbre, and provides a joint forum for exchanging novel insights and forging collaborations across disciplines to help address challenges in our understanding of timbre from empirical, theoretical, and computational perspectives.

Timbre 2023 will feature a program of new research and work in progress, panel sessions and tutorials, headlined by [keynote talks](keynotes/) discussing timbre from 'unexpected' perspectives: **Nina Sun Eidsheim** (UCLA) on timbre and vibration, **Makis Solomos** (Paris 8) on timbre and listening, **Charles Spence** (Oxford) on timbre and crossmodality, and **Jesse Engel** (Google, likely remote) on timbre and artificial intelligence. In foregrounding the interdisciplinarity of timbre and its application as an important parameter in orchestration, the [**ACTOR Timbre and Orchestration Summer School**](https://www.actorproject.org/timbre-and-orchestration-summer-school) will engage with current perspectives on acoustics, analysis, composition, perception, semantics, and voice. 

**Environmental Statement**: The steering committee of the International Conference on Timbre and the Timbre 2023 local chairs are committed to lessening the environmental impact of the conference. We pledge to offset/ compensate for at least a portion of the carbon footprint generated as a result of the conference's activity (e.g., air travel, physical infrastructure) by investing a possible surplus of the budget in initiatives such as [Eden Reforestation Projects](https://www.edenprojects.org/) or [Co2 Compensate](https://www.co2compensate.org/home), or other similar schemes.
