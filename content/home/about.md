Timbre poses multifaceted research questions at the crossroads of psychology, cognitive neuroscience, musicology, acoustics, and engineering.
**Timbre 2023** establishes a tradition of [triennial gatherings around timbre](https://timbreconference.org/), providing a  truly interdisciplinary forum for exchanging novel perspectives and forging collaborations across the emerging cross-disciplinary community, to help address challenges in our understanding of timbre from empirical, theoretical, and computational perspectives. 

Four Keynote Talks from distinguished experts will discuss timbre from four unexpected perspectives: 
**Nina Sun Eidsheim** (University of California Los Angeles) on voice and timbre,
**Makis Solomos** (University Paris 8) on timbre and listening, 
**Charles Spence** (University of Oxford) on timbre and multimodality, and 
**Jesse Engel** (Google Magenta) on artificial intelligence and timbre.
More information is available [here](keynotes/).

The first ever [**Timbre and Orchestration Summer School**](https://www.actorproject.org/timbre-and-orchestration-summer-school) is held in conjunction with the conference. In foregrounding the interdisciplinarity of timbre and its application as an important parameter in orchestration, the Summer School engages with current scientific debates on analysis, composition, perception, semantics, voice, acoustics, and audio content. The Summer School runs 8â€“12 July 2023, with the first two days involving tutorial sessions and the final three being embedded in the conference program.
