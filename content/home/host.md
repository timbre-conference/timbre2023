Thessaloniki is the second largest city of Greece and capital city of Central Macedonia’s administrative district. It is renown for its Ancient Greek, Roman, and Byzantine monuments, charming shopping streets, beautiful seafront, a luscious local cuisine, and a bustling nightlife. Founded in 315 B.C. and named after a stepsister of Alexander the Great, **the city has remained a crossroads of cultures and civilizations for over 2,300 years; just as timbre has been a crossroads of disciplines since Helmholtz**. It is nowadays considered to be Greece's real cultural capital, acclaimed for its festivals, events, galleries, and museums, including 15 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
