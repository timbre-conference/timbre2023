Thessaloniki is the second largest city of Greece and its real cultural capital. It is renown for its Ancient Greek, Roman, and Byzantine monuments, including 15 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, charming shopping streets, beautiful seafront, a luscious local cuisine, and a bustling nightlife. Founded in 315 B.C. and named after the stepsister of Alexander the Great, the city has remained a crossroads of cultures and civilizations for over 2,300 years; just as timbre has been a crossroads of disciplines since Helmholtz. Thessaloniki is located on the Thermaic Gulf, at the northwest corner of the Aegean Sea. It is a major transportation hub for Greece and southeastern Europe, offering easy access to the Greek islands and inland. An official travel guide may be found [here](https://www.thessaloniki.travel), including information about how to get to Thessaloniki and how to move around the city.
