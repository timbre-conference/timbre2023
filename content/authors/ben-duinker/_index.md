# About

Duinker has performed as a soloist and chamber musician across Canada, the United States, and Europe, and has won prizes at competitions including the OSM Standard Life Competition, PASIC Solo Percussion Competition, the Universal Marimba Competition, and the Prix D’Europe. His concerto performances have been described as displaying “breath-holding physical grace” (the Halifax Chronicle Herald) and as “revealing exceptional dexterity and precision” (La Presse, Montreal). As a chamber musician, Duinker has worked with groups such as Sixtrum, Ensemble Contemporain de Montreal, Collectif9, SMCQ, Bradyworks, Viva Voce, and (insert TITLE) Marimba Duo, which he co-founded with Greg Samek. His most frequent outlet for performance has been with Architek Percussion, a Montreal-based quartet that has, since their inception in 2012, premiered over 60 works, toured extensively across Canada as well as appearing in the United States and Europe, and appeared on six commercial albums. Duinker's principal teachers were Aiyun Huang, Fabrice Marandola, and James Faraday, and he has also worked with Steven Schick and Bogdan Bacanu. Duinker appears on recordings released by Ambiances Magnétiques, ATMA Classique, Centrediscs, Constellation Records, Redshift Records, and Mode Records, and has frequently performed on live CBC broadcasts.
