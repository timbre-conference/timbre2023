# About

**Kit Vaughan Soden** is a composer, researcher, and music educator. Kit Soden is currently pursuing a Doctorate of Music at McGill University, studying with Philippe Leroux and Stephen McAdmas. He is a student member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) and the Music Perception and Cognition Lab (MPCL). His research interests include exploring the relationships between timbre and emotional response, as well as connections between linguistic and musical affects. He works as part of the Orchestration and Perception Project, which investigates how composers implicitly employ auditory grouping processes. The research includes analysis and annotation of musical scores, identifying instances of auditory groupings appearing as orchestral effects. Kit is also collaborating on a large-scale perceptual study investigating the representation of basic emotional categories in dramatic music. This study is working towards a functional theory to describe the interaction of both visual and auditory components in film noir and opera.
