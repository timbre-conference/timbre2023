# About

**Charalampos Saitis** is based at the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), where he studies communication acoustics with a focus on timbre perception and “metaphors we listen with”, and their application to research and innovation in digital music. This involves using empirical and computational methods to understand different modalities of experience, interaction, and control between the digital music “user” (listeners, performers, producers) and sound as a multimodal semiotic system. His previous research has focused on verbal-data-driven analysis of cognitive representations of timbre and more recently on digital interactive cross-sensory games. Scholarly contributions include co-editing the scientific volumes *Timbre: Acoustics, Perception, & Cognition* (2019), the first dedicated to a comprehensive and authoritative presentation of the state of the art in research on this foundational aspect of hearing, and *Musical Haptics* (2018), an original interdisciplinary overview of the role of haptic feedback in musical practice and interaction. He is a founding member of the International Conference on Timbre.
