# About

**Makis Solomos** was born in Greece and now lives in France, working as Professor of Musicology at the _Université Paris 8_ and as director of the research team MUSIDANSE. He has published many books and articles about new music, and he is one of the main international specialists of Xenakis’ music. His book _From Music to Sound: The Emergence of Sound in 20th- and 21st-Century Music_ (Routledge, 2019) examines how new music brought about a change of paradigm — a mutation — on listening, moving from a culture centred on the note to a culture of sound. His new book _Towards an Ecology of Sound: The Living World, the Mental and the Social in Today’s Music, Sound Art and Artivisms_ (Routledge, 2023) deals with an enlarged notion of ecology for music and sound, mixing environmental issues and socio-political questions. He co-organized, the Xenakis22: Centenary International Symposium and he is the editor of _Révolutions Xenakis_ (Éditions de l’Œil – Philharmonie de Paris, 2022).
