# About

**Asterios Zacharakis** am a post-doctoral researcher on music perception and cognition at the Cognitive and Computational Musicology Group (CCM) of the School of Music Studies at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I am particularly interested in the semantic information conveyed by musical sounds and the way extra-musical meaning emerges from musical structures.
