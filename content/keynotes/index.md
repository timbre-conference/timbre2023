### Nina Sun Eidsheim: <span style="color:#8E44AD">How covert metaphors shape timbral theories, listening, and practices</span>

If music and sound are “thick events” that necessarily exceed our ability to grasp them fully, what resources can we employ to make (at least partial) sense of them? Metaphorical language works as one resource, shaping the ways in which we perceive and understand not only music, but also one another and the world. Western musical thought has been shaped by several dominant metaphors, which not only influence the vocabulary we use to describe and analyze music but also impact our musical imaginaries, performance practices, and sensory access to timbre. In this keynote, I want to shift attention from what I call lexical metaphors (metaphors that are evident in language, such as “amber voice”) to covert metaphors (metaphors that aren’t evident in language, but are rather hidden in listening and performance practices, theories, methodologies, and sensibilities), and to show how they contribute to the formation of our timbral understanding. Moreover, I will argue that because many of these covert-metaphor paradigms were established during a time of fervent European nationalism and continued to develop under colonialist violence and expansion, many in the service of imagining nations and defining the self in meetings with the Other. Finally, I will argue that timbral studies must re-examine the covert-metaphor paradigms that have shaped the field, critically record their impact on the world, and also ask whether they best support our aspirations for the field.

[Nina Sun Eidsheim](https://schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/people/nina-eidsheim/) (she/her) is the author of [Sensing Sound: Singing and Listening as Vibrational Practice](https://www.dukeupress.edu/sensing-sound) and [The Race of Sound: Listening, Timbre, and Vocality in African American Music](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9sn4k8dr); co-editing [Oxford Handbook of Voice Studies](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28026); Co-editor of the [Refiguring American Music](https://www.dukeupress.edu/series/Refiguring-American-Music) book series for Duke University Press. She received her bachelor of music from the voice program at the Agder Conservatory (Norway); MFA in vocal performance from the California Institute of the Arts; and Ph.D. in Musicology from the University of California, San Diego. Eidsheim is Professor of Musicology, UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music and founder and director of the UCLA Practice-based Experimental Epistemology Research ([PEER](https://www.instagram.com/peerlabucla/)) Lab, an experimental research Lab dedicated to decolonializing data, methodology, and analysis, in and through multisensory creative practices. Current projects include a book collaboration with Wadada Leo Smith and a multi-model project that maps networks of metaphors that structure musical community, discourse, and practice.

### Makis Solomos: <span style="color:#8E44AD">on timbre and listening (Title TBC)</span>

[Makis Solomos](https://musidanse.univ-paris8.fr/makis-solomos) was born in Greece and now lives in France, working as Professor of Musicology at the Université Paris 8 and as director of the research team MUSIDANSE. He has published many books and articles about new music, and he is one of the main international specialists of Xenakis’ music. His book _From Music to Sound. The Emergence of Sound in 20th- and 21st-Century Music_ (Routledge, 2019) examines how new music brought about a change of paradigm—a mutation—on listening, moving from a culture centred on the note to a culture of sound. His new book _Towards an Ecology of Sound. The Living World, the Mental and the Social in Today’s Music, Sound Art and Artivisms_ (Routledge, 2023) deals with an enlarged notion of ecology for music and sound, mixing environmental issues and socio-political questions. He co-organized, the Xenakis22: Centenary International Symposium and he is the editor of Révolutions Xenakis (Éditions de l’Œil – Philharmonie de Paris, 2022).

### Charles Spence: <span style="color:#8E44AD">Crossmodal correspondences involving timbre: Theory and application</span>

[Charles Spence](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/charles-spence) is a world-famous experimental psychologist with a specialisation in [neuroscience-inspired multisensory design](https://vimeo.com/170509976). He has worked with many of the world’s largest companies across the globe since establishing the Crossmodal Research Laboratory (CRL) at the Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University in 1997. Prof. Spence has published over 1,100 academic articles and edited or authored 16 books including the Prose prize-winning _The perfect meal_ (2014; Willey Blackwell), and the international bestseller _Gastrophysics: The new science of eating_ (2017; Penguin Viking) – winner of the 2019 Le Grand Prix de la Culture Gastronomique from Académie Internationale de la Gastronomie. His latest book _Sensehacking_ was published in 2021 (Penguin). Much of Prof. Spence’s work focuses on the design of enhanced multisensory food and drink experiences, through collaborations with chefs, baristas, mixologists, chocolatiers, perfumiers, and the food and beverage, and flavour and fragrance industries. Prof. Spence has worked extensively in the world of multisensory experiential wine and coffee and has also worked extensively on the question of how technology will transform our dining/drinking experiences in the future.

### Jesse Engel: <span style="color:#8E44AD">Disentangling Style and Structure in Generative Music Models</span>

<span style="color:gray;">(likely remote, TBC)</span> </br>
[Jesse Engel](https://research.google/people/JesseEngel/) is lead research scientist on [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/), a research team within Google Brain exploring the role of machine learning in creative applications. He has a UC Berkeley 'cubed' degree (BA, PhD, Postdoc) and his research background is diverse, including work in Astrophysics, Materials Science, Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, Computational Neuroscience, and now Machine Learning. His research on Magenta includes creating new generative models for audio (DDSP, NSynth), symbolic music (MusicVAE, GrooVAE), adapting to user preferences (Latent Constraints, MIDI-Me), and work to close the gap between research and musical applications (NSynth Super, Magenta Studio). Previously he worked with Andrew Ng to help found the Baidu Silicon Valley AI Lab and was a key contributor to DeepSpeech2, a speech recognition system named one of the ‘Top 10 Breakthroughs of 2016’ by MIT Technology Review. Outside of work, he is also a professional-level jazz guitarist, and likes to include in his bio that he once played an opening set for the Dalai Lama at the Greek Theatre.
