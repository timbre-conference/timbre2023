Even when the intention is genuine, rarely music technology projects go beyond one discipline servicing the other. What happens when we go candidly yet rigorously beyond cohabitation, from multi- to interdisciplinarity; from science-as-research to a plurality of research practices; from a service model to one that embraces the complex interrelation between disciplines across their porous barriers? Music technology research has a great potential to be truly interdisciplinary, not as add-on nor an in-between, but as a field in itself, a fluid third stream. Such endeavour is possible only if we go beyond a mere cohabitation of the parent disciplines, dissolving taxonomies, challenging epistemic commitments, towards hybridizing as a way to evolve. We hope to provoke a rich discussion during follow-up interactive sessions, in order to generate constructive ways forward for rich interdisciplinary music technology research projects.\nThis talk will propose a forum to go to the roots of the next big questions of our respective fields, and embrace the richness and complexities of their agonistic diversity. We hope to generate constructive ways forward for rich interdisciplinary music technology research projects.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"35322ecb3062cf835e536fccd16a7149","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/tue/keynote-1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/tue/keynote-1/","section":"session","summary":"Tuesday | 12:15 - 13:00 | Tanna Hall (McGill)","tags":["COBS","Keynote","Tuesday"],"title":"Keynote 1: P.

Ce fut d’abord un système de traits préfigurant les codes barre, et puis s’est généralisée la forme d’une ondulation (wave form) noire sur fond blanc pour les films en noir et blanc, ou bleue sur fond jaune pour les films en couleur. Ainsi le son devient une image, et les techniciens du cinéma avaient l’habitude d’évaluer le report optique d’une bande sonore selon de critères photographiques : piqué, netteté, grain, contraste, etc.\nA partir de là, j’ai expérimenté le report de cette ondulation, de cette modulation, sur diverses sortes d’images, en multipliant les transferts d’un support sur l’autre, soit par les moyens d’interface numériques, soit par de simples calques ou empreintes analogiques faits à la main. Ces recherches m’ont conduit, après avoir fait voyager un support sonore (une phrase), par des reports successifs, à essayer de la lire à nouveau pour constater si le message d’origine s’était conservé, avec éventuellement quelles altérations, quels accidents, survenus pendant le long voyage à travers différents espaces. J’ai été ainsi amené à faire réaliser des lecteurs capables de déchiffrer le message sonore par lecture d’une image contenant sa forme visuelle plusieurs fois reportée. Le résultat était concluant avec la restitution, parfaitement identifiable, de la phrase d’origine.\nDans le prolongement de ces expériences, mes nouvelles recherches portent sur la transformation de la parole chantée et de la musique en images, c’est-à-dire de signaux sonores en signaux optiques. Avec toujours le même objectif de transférer successivement le signal, la modulation (la wave form), d’un support sur l’autre, en passant par des supports traditionnels comme le disque vinyle, par des CD numériques, par des empreintes sur différentes matières, par des transcriptions de l’ordre du dessin. L’objectif sera à nouveau de constater ce que devient une forme musicale (y compris le chant), après être passée par ces transferts successifs.\nL’exposé de mes recherches pourra être illustré par des images, par la présentation des instruments de déchiffrage, et par des enregistrements.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7025af96790f5e2b2b85fbf4d64b9980","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/keynote-2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/keynote-2/","section":"session","summary":"Wednesday | 10:15 - 11:00 | B421 (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Keynote"],"title":"Keynote 2: Alain Fleisher","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Wednesday Time: 11:30 - 12:30 Location: Université de Montréal Room: TBD Overview CIRMMT Research Axis 2: Music information research Presenters ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d8b1323d589492505187fc9fe93e3a53","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/panel-2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/panel-2/","section":"session","summary":"Wednesday | 11:30 - 12:30 | TBD (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Oral presentation","Panel"],"title":"Panel: Research Axis 2","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Wednesday Time: 14:00 - 14:45 Location: Université de Montréal Room: B421 Speakers Title “Where to Encode Musical Information” Description Music-making and listener engagement are emerging in new modalities, sites, and mediums, creating an imperative to re-examine cultural and personal channels for musical experiences. Musical information and its encoding can provide a consistent perspective across practices, historical periods, and cultures, and this perspective may support a concerned community of practice.\nSites and mediums are two salient factors, and their characteristics affect listeners’ modality of engagement. In modern epoch marked with a certain technological capacity, the distributed, mobile, situated, and participatory are among other possible characteristics that transform the definition of sites and medium. For the sustainability of professional musical practice, we may reconsider the social contract of composer, performer, and audience by examining what changes in perspectives are required concerning musical information and its encoding.\nMusical experience is a sensorial phenomenon that is highly subjected to variance based on a modality of engagement. Recent neuroscientific findings indicate sustained experience changes neural function. This means that the kind of musical experience we may expect is loosely presumed based on prior experiences, with a degree of confidence, within which the modality of engagement is also expected. Towards a sustainable musical practice, the question where to go from here can be shortcut by questioning where to encode musical information. Since the paradigm of Western common practice was historically effective, we may still unwittingly subsume contemporary practice to that paradigm, regardless of interactive music or DSP for new instruments. However, the history of the common practice was about the process of musical discourse regarding where to encode musical information, the process of acculturation. Perhaps, we have been too much focusing on music as a product of culture or creative individuals, not enough on musical interaction.\nFor musical interaction, ‘where to encode’ comes as a novel question that future music research should address to elucidate the intrinsically multimodal nature of music and its impact on sociocultural human perception, cognition, and functional organization of the human brain. In multimedia context, musical interaction can also function as a central motivation for integrating other media and enabling participatory engagement. This keynote will address the motivation, aims, and methods of musical interaction research as well as its conceptual framework with a set of enabling dimensions for situating potential values in the relationship between people, music, and technologies. For this research agenda, we will discuss an interdisciplinary requirement and collaborative landscape to move us forward with a formative process of defining a locus with emerging criteria.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"14514d0afa7fe068c1b8ca6f130b1b74","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/keynote-3/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/keynote-3/","section":"session","summary":"Wednesday | 14:00 - 14:45 | B421 (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Keynote"],"title":"Keynote 3: I.

It has dramatically altered the way that people and communities’ access or are excluded from public spaces and changed the complex role that sound plays in framing urban experience. Indeed, while current noise policies and public discourse focus almost exclusively on reducing sound levels, the unprecedented experience of “quietened” cities during lockdown both highlighted the unsustainability of this goal, related as it was to the reduction in economic, social and cultural activity and opportunity. It also led more people to notice the transformation of the urban soundscape and listen to their immediate environment.

First, I would like to focus on the impact of involving non-academic professional musicians coming from diverse cultural backgrounds in partnerships that aim at analysing their creative processes and/or designing technology that could best meet their artistic vision and social identity (Pras et al., 2021). Second, the purpose of the exchanges will be to bridge gaps between audio engineering and music technology to develop useful applications with a high level of sound quality (Bauer et al., forthcoming).

It aims to foster inclusive pedagogical approaches that exploit technology to support lifelong learning and creative expression, and will be based on previous research that will serve as a springboard to the group session.\nPositioned within gerontechnology (concerned with the role of technology for enhancing later life), our participatory action research (PAR) was organised around ten case study later life contexts. Results have revealed older adults’ openness to exploration of technology as a vehicle for creative expression through collaborative, exploratory musical activities. Moments of significant interpersonal connection through music were mediated by a range of music technologies. Participants demonstrated the capacity for creative expression and musical development using iPad Apps, electronic instruments, motion sensor technologies, and online platforms.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8cd06e1f6b74806f10a824749aa0b97c","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/fri/interactive-session-8/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/fri/interactive-session-8/","section":"session","summary":"Friday | 9:00 - 10:30 | C-201 (McGill)","tags":["Friday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 8: Creative Later-Life in a Digital Age","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Friday Time: 09:00 - 10:30 Location: McGill University Room: C-204 Title Motion capture in ecological situations Presenter ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1cf442ea19ab4abe4e9f9baa1d5e7edf","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/fri/interactive-session-9/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/fri/interactive-session-9/","section":"session","summary":"Friday | 9:00 - 10:30 | C-204 (McGill) something else","tags":["Friday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 9: Motion capture in ecological situations","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Friday Time: 11:00 - 12:30 Location: McGill University Room: C-201/Studio 22 Title 3D Music Production Presenter ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d36331377a11338629d2b47402a27255","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/fri/interactive-session-10/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/fri/interactive-session-10/","section":"session","summary":"Friday | 11:00 - 12:30 | C-201/Studio 22 (McGill)","tags":["Friday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 10: 3D Music Production","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Friday Time: 11:00 - 12:30 Location: McGill University Room: C-201/Studio 22 Title Artificial Intelligence driving the shape of new realities: what to expect from the music in the Metaverse Era\nPresenter ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"370d62e21079b1b785568f733c533fc7","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/fri/interactive-session-11/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/fri/interactive-session-11/","section":"session","summary":"Friday | 11:00 - 12:30 | C-201/Studio 22 (McGill)","tags":["Friday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 11: Artificial Intelligence driving the shape of new realities","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Friday Time: 14:00 - 16:00 Location: McGill University Room: Tanna Schulich Hall Information coming soon.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bf79cb2251cc7273d6ea8c3f4e469a4b","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/fri/round-table-3/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/fri/round-table-3/","section":"session","summary":"Friday | 14:00 - 16:00 | Tanna Hall (McGill)","tags":["Friday","Round table"],"title":"Round Table 3 and Conclusion","type":"session"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Slides can be added in a few ways:\nCreate slides using Wowchemy’s Slides feature and link using slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

It will include the first ever Timbre and Orchestration Summer School, a synergy with the ACTOR Partnership. Timbre 2023 offers a unique opportunity to engage with a growing body of scholars, researchers, and practitioners working across disciplines of music, cognitive science, acoustics, and computer science to study how the human brain accesses, processes, analyses, and organises timbral information of acoustic signals.\nThe scope of the timbre community traditionally extends beyond academia across the music and creative industries due to strong applications of timbre in machine listening, audio engineering, sound design and synthesis, acoustical and digital instrument making, spatial/ 3D audio, and augmented/ virtual/ extended reality. Timbre 2023 is a perfect place to showcase your organisation’s latest research and products and follow state of the art and new breakthroughs in the scientific discourse on timbre. We expect around 120 participants attending physically.\nEnvironmental Statement The steering committee of the International Conference on Timbre and the Timbre 2023 local chairs are committed to lessening the environmental impact of the conference. We pledge to offset/ compensate for at least a portion of the carbon footprint generated as a result of the conference’s activity (e.g., air travel, physical infrastructure) by investing a possible surplus of the budget in initiatives such as Eden Reforestation Projects or Co2 Compensate, or other similar schemes.\nSponsorship Opportunities We have three tiers of special registration fees for sponsors, but we can tailor packages to specific requirements.

This is not part of the social program and should be arranged separately by the participants by contacting Seikilo directly to book an available time slot.\nThis one-hour workshop will begin by taking a closer look at the sound and aesthetics of a reconstructed ancient Greek lyre and on the music system of antiquity in general. It will proceed with a hands-on lyre playing of the “Epitaph of Seikilos”, the oldest complete melody (with lyrics) that survives today! This will demonstrate that this ancient musical instrument is much simpler to learn than a guitar or most of the other modern instruments which probably explains why it was used as a teaching tool for almost every child in ancient Greece.\nCost per person: 40€ More information at SEIKILO Contact Seikilo directly at info@seikilo.com to book an available time slot Friday: 7 July 2023 19:00 - 21:00 Informal meetup for the Summer School at Tabya Venue: Tabya Location: Konstantinou Melenikou 14, Thessaloniki 546 35, Greece Saturday: 8 July 2023 20:00 - 22:00 Welcome reception for the Summer School Drinks \u0026amp; DJ set by Marcelo Caetano\nMonday: 10 July 2023 Choose either of the following options:\n18:30 - 20:30 Thessaloniki walking tour starting at Rotonda and ending at the city port The tour will be kindly provided by the Thessaloniki Tourism Organisation but optional entrance in the interior of the Rotonda monument will require a 6€ worth ticket (students should have their IDs with them to take advantage of the reduced price).\nAvailable slots: 60 Fill your names in this form to book your slot 19:00 - 20:00 Guided tour on ancient Greek musical instruments at SEIKILO Cultural Space Available slots: 20 Address: Vasileos Irakleiou 4 Fill your names in this form to book your slot Tuesday: 11 July 2023 from 17:00 to 20:30 at Tellogleion 17:00 Cross-modal wine-tasting event with wines kindly provided by Ktima Gerovassiliou 18:00 Welcome reception 19:00 Concert at SEIKILO music Ancient Greek Music by SEIKILO music\nSEIKILO music is an ensemble that performs with handcrafted ancient Greek musical instruments.

Teloglion occupies an impressive, modern, high specifications building with a panoramic view over the Thermaic Gulf and Olympus, set in a large green park at the northeast end of the campus of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh). Teloglion was founded in 1972, when the art collection and the entire property of Nestor and Aliki Telloglou were donated to AUTh. Today Teloglion’s collection consists of more than 7000 works which tell the story of modern Greek art up to the present day. Part of the largest university in Greece, Teloglion links research, teaching, scholarship, the child, the worker, the third age and art and culture in their broadest sense.\nAddress Agiou Dimitriou 159Α, 54636 Thessaloniki Bus stop ‘Teloglio’ Bus lines 24, 17, 37 Bus stop ‘Plateia Pavlou Mela’ Bus line 15 About the Host Founded in 1926, AUTh is the largest university in Greece. It is widely recognized as a vibrant center of learning which draws its inspiration from a long tradition of academic achievement. This can be supported, among other factors, by the fact that so much in science, as in the arts and religious studies, medicine and technology, it prides itself on its international role. The School of Music Studies was founded in 1984 as part of AUTh’s Faculty of Fine Arts. It is the first university music department which has operated in Greece and in general it is the first tertiary music studies institution in the history of modern Greece. The School of Music Studies features the Sound \u0026amp; Music Technology Lab which perfoms interdisciplinary research in the areas of psychoacoustics, music cognition and computational creativity.\nHow to travel to and from Thessaloniki The international Thessaloniki Airport ‘Makedonia’ (SKG) connects Thessaloniki with approximately 38 countries and more than 60 foreign cities, as well as 35 cities and islands in Greece. The airport is located just 16 km from Thessaloniki. Bus service is provided between the Airport and the city of Thessaloniki, with connections to the Central Railway Station and the ‘KTEL Makedonia’ Intercity Bus Station. The bus stop is located at the departures area, in front of entrance 3 of T1. Tickets can be purchased by the bus driver. ΤΑΧΙ service is available at the airport. TAXI stand is located at the arrivals area between T1 and T2 (between exit 3 and 4).\nThe Central Railway Station connects Thessaloniki with Athens (about 4 hours). Trains to the city of Larissa (90 minutes) serve several intermediate stops and provide access to the beautiful ’turquoise’ beaches of Pieria. There are also daily trains to the cities of Edessa (renown for its Waterfalls natural preserve) and Florina (from where one can visit the Great Prespa and Small Prespa lakes, a beautiful pristine area shared by three countries).\nThe ‘KTEL Makedonia’ Intercity Bus Station serves many domestic routes in Central Macedonia and the rest of Greece, as well as international destinations in Turkey, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Czechia, and Slobakia.\nIn the summer you can catch a ferry or a cruise ship from the Port of Thessaloniki to the Sporades islands (e.g., Skopelos), the Cyclades islands (e.g., Mykonos), islands in the northeastern Aegean Sea (e.g., Lesbos, Chios, Ikaria), and even Izmir (Turkey) and Athens.\nChalkidiki and Mount Athos South of Thessaloniki are the three peninsulas of Chalkidiki: Kassandra, Sithonia and Athos. Sandy beaches with crystal clear waters in counterpoint with mountainous landscapes make Chalkidiki one of the most popular summer destinations for domestic and international tourists, especially for Thessaloniki residents (“σαν τη Χαλκιδική δεν έχει”). Buses to various places in Chalkidiki depart from the ‘KTEL Chalkidikis’ Bus Station, which is located in the outskirts of Thessaloniki and can be reached from the ‘KTEL Makedonia’ station via the Bus line 45.\nThe Athos peninsula is home to the autonomous monastic community of Mount Athos, comprising 20 monasteries and around 2,000 Eastern Orthodox monks from Greece and elsewhere. Sadly, only males are permitted to enter. For foreign visitors, reservations need to be made six months in advance. Information can be found here.\nPella, Vergina, Dion and Mount Olympus West of Thessaloniki are the important archeological sites of Pella and Vergina. Pella was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Macedon (or Macedonia) and the birthplace of Alexander the Great and of his father, King Phillip II. Vergina is the site of ancient Aegae, the first capital of Macedon before the shift to Pella, and later the burial place for its kings. The archeological site is famous for the Royal Tombs, including the tomb of King Phillip II.\nSouthwest of Thessaloniki is Mount Olympus, Greece’s highest mountain.

If music and sound are “thick events” that necessarily exceed our ability to grasp them fully, what resources can we employ to make (at least partial) sense of them? Metaphorical language works as one resource, shaping the ways in which we perceive and understand not only music, but also one another and the world. Western musical thought has been shaped by several dominant metaphors, which not only influence the vocabulary we use to describe and analyze music but also impact our musical imaginaries, performance practices, and sensory access to timbre. In this keynote, I want to shift attention from what I call lexical metaphors (metaphors that are evident in language, such as “amber voice”) to covert metaphors (metaphors that aren’t evident in language, but are rather hidden in listening and performance practices, theories, methodologies, and sensibilities), and to show how they contribute to the formation of our timbral understanding. Moreover, I will argue that because many of these covert-metaphor paradigms were established during a time of fervent European nationalism and continued to develop under colonialist violence and expansion, many in the service of imagining nations and defining the self in meetings with the Other. Finally, I will argue that timbral studies must re-examine the covert-metaphor paradigms that have shaped the field, critically record their impact on the world, and also ask whether they best support our aspirations for the field.\nNina Sun Eidsheim (she/her) is the author of Sensing Sound: Singing and Listening as Vibrational Practice and The Race of Sound: Listening, Timbre, and Vocality in African American Music; co-editor of the Oxford Handbook of Voice Studies; co-editor of the Refiguring American Music book series for Duke University Press. She received her bachelor of music from the voice program at the Agder Conservatory (Norway); MFA in vocal performance from the California Institute of the Arts; and Ph.D. in Musicology from the University of California, San Diego. Eidsheim is Professor of Musicology, UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music and founder and director of the UCLA Practice-based Experimental Epistemology Research (PEER) Lab, an experimental research Lab dedicated to decolonializing data, methodology, and analysis, in and through multisensory creative practices. Current projects include a book collaboration with Wadada Leo Smith and a multi-model project that maps networks of metaphors that structure musical community, discourse, and practice.\nMakis Solomos: Timbre and sound: notes on the resilience of the notion of timbre Abstract. Timbre is one of the elements that make up the history of musical modernity, a history that leads from music to sound. Other elements are equally important: noise (with which timbre forms a kind of dialectic); listening (thinking in terms of timbre or sound implies a paradigmatic shift in listening); the idea of composing (composing sound or timbre, not taking them to be natural categories); the sensation of immersion and space (which emphasises the materiality of sound). The notion of timbre was very important at a central moment in this history, in the 1970s and 80s (particularly with spectral music). One might have thought that, thereafter, it would have disappeared, leaving the concepts of sound, noise or space to take precedence. This was not the case. Not only does it continue to be used to this day in studies of perception; it is also now used in other fields such as ethnomusicology. How can this resilience of the notion of timbre be explained? I will hypothesise here that the term has retained its relevance because, while introducing to the new materialism that characterises the emergence of a culture centred on sound, it allows us to retain the strength of the hermeneutic tradition of music.\nMakis Solomos was born in Greece and now lives in France, working as Professor of Musicology at the Université Paris 8 and as director of the research team MUSIDANSE. He has published many books and articles about new music, and he is one of the main international specialists of Xenakis’ music. His book From Music to Sound. The Emergence of Sound in 20th- and 21st-Century Music (Routledge, 2019) examines how new music brought about a change of paradigm—a mutation—on listening, moving from a culture centred on the note to a culture of sound. His new book Towards an Ecology of Sound. The Living World, the Mental and the Social in Today’s Music, Sound Art and Artivisms (Routledge, 2023) deals with an enlarged notion of ecology for music and sound, mixing environmental issues and socio-political questions. He co-organized, the Xenakis22: Centenary International Symposium and he is the editor of Révolutions Xenakis (Éditions de l’Œil – Philharmonie de Paris, 2022). …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ae2b9e20728a7935c40f33b3013854dd","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/keynotes/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/keynotes/","section":"","summary":"Nina Sun Eidsheim, UCLA Makis Solomos, Paris 8 Charles Spence, Oxford Jesse Engel, Google Nina Sun Eidsheim: How covert metaphors shape timbral theories, listening, and practices Abstract.
