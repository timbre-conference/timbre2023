Even when the intention is genuine, rarely music technology projects go beyond one discipline servicing the other. What happens when we go candidly yet rigorously beyond cohabitation, from multi- to interdisciplinarity; from science-as-research to a plurality of research practices; from a service model to one that embraces the complex interrelation between disciplines across their porous barriers? Music technology research has a great potential to be truly interdisciplinary, not as add-on nor an in-between, but as a field in itself, a fluid third stream. Such endeavour is possible only if we go beyond a mere cohabitation of the parent disciplines, dissolving taxonomies, challenging epistemic commitments, towards hybridizing as a way to evolve. We hope to provoke a rich discussion during follow-up interactive sessions, in order to generate constructive ways forward for rich interdisciplinary music technology research projects.\nThis talk will propose a forum to go to the roots of the next big questions of our respective fields, and embrace the richness and complexities of their agonistic diversity.

Ce fut d’abord un système de traits préfigurant les codes barre, et puis s’est généralisée la forme d’une ondulation (wave form) noire sur fond blanc pour les films en noir et blanc, ou bleue sur fond jaune pour les films en couleur. Ainsi le son devient une image, et les techniciens du cinéma avaient l’habitude d’évaluer le report optique d’une bande sonore selon de critères photographiques : piqué, netteté, grain, contraste, etc.\nA partir de là, j’ai expérimenté le report de cette ondulation, de cette modulation, sur diverses sortes d’images, en multipliant les transferts d’un support sur l’autre, soit par les moyens d’interface numériques, soit par de simples calques ou empreintes analogiques faits à la main. Ces recherches m’ont conduit, après avoir fait voyager un support sonore (une phrase), par des reports successifs, à essayer de la lire à nouveau pour constater si le message d’origine s’était conservé, avec éventuellement quelles altérations, quels accidents, survenus pendant le long voyage à travers différents espaces. J’ai été ainsi amené à faire réaliser des lecteurs capables de déchiffrer le message sonore par lecture d’une image contenant sa forme visuelle plusieurs fois reportée. Le résultat était concluant avec la restitution, parfaitement identifiable, de la phrase d’origine.\nDans le prolongement de ces expériences, mes nouvelles recherches portent sur la transformation de la parole chantée et de la musique en images, c’est-à-dire de signaux sonores en signaux optiques. Avec toujours le même objectif de transférer successivement le signal, la modulation (la wave form), d’un support sur l’autre, en passant par des supports traditionnels comme le disque vinyle, par des CD numériques, par des empreintes sur différentes matières, par des transcriptions de l’ordre du dessin. L’objectif sera à nouveau de constater ce que devient une forme musicale (y compris le chant), après être passée par ces transferts successifs.\nL’exposé de mes recherches pourra être illustré par des images, par la présentation des instruments de déchiffrage, et par des enregistrements.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7025af96790f5e2b2b85fbf4d64b9980","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/keynote-2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/keynote-2/","section":"session","summary":"Wednesday | 10:15 - 11:00 | B421 (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Keynote"],"title":"Keynote 2: Alain Fleisher","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Wednesday Time: 11:30 - 12:30 Location: Université de Montréal Room: TBD Overview CIRMMT Research Axis 2: Music information research Presenters Guillaume Boutard ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d8b1323d589492505187fc9fe93e3a53","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/panel-2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/panel-2/","section":"session","summary":"Wednesday | 11:30 - 12:30 | TBD (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Oral presentation","Panel"],"title":"Panel: Research Axis 2","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Wednesday Time: 14:00 - 14:45 Location: Université de Montréal Room: B421 Speakers Insook Choi Robin Bargar Title “Where to Encode Musical Information” Description Music-making and listener engagement are emerging in new modalities, sites, and mediums, creating an imperative to re-examine cultural and personal channels for musical experiences. Musical information and its encoding can provide a consistent perspective across practices, historical periods, and cultures, and this perspective may support a concerned community of practice.\nSites and mediums are two salient factors, and their characteristics affect listeners’ modality of engagement. In modern epoch marked with a certain technological capacity, the distributed, mobile, situated, and participatory are among other possible characteristics that transform the definition of sites and medium. For the sustainability of professional musical practice, we may reconsider the social contract of composer, performer, and audience by examining what changes in perspectives are required concerning musical information and its encoding.\nMusical experience is a sensorial phenomenon that is highly subjected to variance based on a modality of engagement. Recent neuroscientific findings indicate sustained experience changes neural function. This means that the kind of musical experience we may expect is loosely presumed based on prior experiences, with a degree of confidence, within which the modality of engagement is also expected. Towards a sustainable musical practice, the question where to go from here can be shortcut by questioning where to encode musical information. Since the paradigm of Western common practice was historically effective, we may still unwittingly subsume contemporary practice to that paradigm, regardless of interactive music or DSP for new instruments. However, the history of the common practice was about the process of musical discourse regarding where to encode musical information, the process of acculturation. Perhaps, we have been too much focusing on music as a product of culture or creative individuals, not enough on musical interaction.\nFor musical interaction, ‘where to encode’ comes as a novel question that future music research should address to elucidate the intrinsically multimodal nature of music and its impact on sociocultural human perception, cognition, and functional organization of the human brain. In multimedia context, musical interaction can also function as a central motivation for integrating other media and enabling participatory engagement. This keynote will address the motivation, aims, and methods of musical interaction research as well as its conceptual framework with a set of enabling dimensions for situating potential values in the relationship between people, music, and technologies.

After reviewing projects derived from and informing Schutz’s own work as percussion soloist and director of the McMaster University Percussion Ensemble, the session will move to break-out groups focused on brainstorming performance-relevant research on the following three topics: (1) how the movements used by performers change the way their music “sounds.” (2) how formal study and assessment of practice strategies can improve our practice. (3) how to formally assess the effect of a performer’s interpretation on audiences responses to new works. Together these topics will provide a fruitful basis for exploring new of relevance to both the scientific study of music, as well as its artistic practice.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"635d6f0668c33596c1b4fb1e448f1516","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/interactive-session-2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/interactive-session-2/","section":"session","summary":" Wednesday | 14:15 - 16:15 | TBD (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 2: Music Psychology and Performing Musicians","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Wednesday Time: 14:15 - 16:15 Location: Université de Montréal Room: TBD Title “Sound Art after COVID: can participatory sound art initiatives lead to a new understanding of sound environments in urban settings?” Presenter Catherine Guastavino Description The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted on and changed many aspects of urban life which contribute to social well- being and economic stability. It has dramatically altered the way that people and communities’ access or are excluded from public spaces and changed the complex role that sound plays in framing urban experience. Indeed, while current noise policies and public discourse focus almost exclusively on reducing sound levels, the unprecedented experience of “quietened” cities during lockdown both highlighted the unsustainability of this goal, related as it was to the reduction in economic, social and cultural activity and opportunity. It also led more people to notice the transformation of the urban soundscape and listen to their immediate environment. This relationship between the soundscape and community activity and the ‘listening turn’ that developed offer the opportunity for a new understanding of sound environments in urban settings informed by innovative forms of collaboration and participation.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"03755203ccc1d714e763d037bd738efb","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/interactive-session-3/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/interactive-session-3/","section":"session","summary":" Wednesday | 14:15 - 16:15 | TBD (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 3: Sound Art after COVID","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Wednesday Time: 16:45 - 17:30 Location: Université de Montréal Room: B421 Information coming soon.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8812b004fac2681ada28334a1d50195c","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/round-table-1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/round-table-1/","section":"session","summary":"Wednesday | 16:45 - 17:30 | B421 (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Round table"],"title":"Round Table 1","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Wednesday Time: 17:30 - 18:30 Location: Université de Montréal Room: B187 (Spat-Gris) Overview Spatialisation sonore immersive: SpatGRIS\nPresenters Mélanie Frisoli Nicola Giannini ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ea9a450a0f214015c71536914b3a46a4","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/workshop-1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/workshop-1/","section":"session","summary":" Wednesday | 17:30 - 18:30 | B187 (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Workshop"],"title":"Workshop 1: Immersive sound spatialization with SpatGRIS","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Wednesday Time: 17:30 - 18:30 Location: Université de Montréal Room: B187 (Spat-Gris) Presenters Ons Barnat Caroline Traube Frédéric Léotar ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"240259474e77efc7bae4f4ca6c980ac9","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/interactive-session-4/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/interactive-session-4/","section":"session","summary":" Wednesday | 17:30 - 18:30 | TBD (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 4","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Wednesday Time: 20:00 - 21:30 Location: Université de Montréal Room: Salle Claude-Champagne Program Nouvel Ensemble Moderne “Anaktoria” ensemble SIXTRUM “PolytopeXXI” Description The second concert will be a tribute to Iannis Xenakis, combining a new instrument/installation, PolytopeXXI, with a masterpiece of the XXth century repertoire, Xenakis’ Pleiades. PolytopeXXI will feature a monumental new instrument: a sort of giant, electronically augmented, audio-luminescent harp, whose strings will be struck by the percussionists of the ensemble SIXTRUM in a new work by Myriam Boucher and Dominic Thibault. The Nouvel Ensemble Moderne will also take part to the concert with the rarely performed Anaktoria, by Iannis Xenakis.\nAbout Polytope XXI Polytope XXI is the name that composers Myriam Boucher and Dominic Thibault have given to their monumental instrumental project: a sort of giant, electronically augmented, audio-luminescent harp, whose strings will be struck by the percussionists of Sixtrum. The structure of the instrument will be equipped with various sensors that will capture and amplify vibrations, while controlling the integrated light and video system.\nThis project finds its inspiration in the first Polytope imagined by Iannis Xenakis, an ‘electronic sculpture combining light, music and structure’, that was presented inside the French Pavilion during Expo67 built in Montreal. It formed a gigantic web of cables suspended in the central space of the pavilion, each cable bearing a multitude of flashing lights that were synchronized with a musical tape – thus creating an artistic work inscribed in space and made of multiple layers of sound and light.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"32405f36d8c303e09387947ccd3b3965","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/wed/concert-2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/wed/concert-2/","section":"session","summary":"Wednesday | 20:00 - 21:30 | Salle Claude-Champagne (UdeM)","tags":["Wednesday","Concert"],"title":"Concert 2: Tribute to Iannis Xenakis","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Thursday Time: 09:00 - 10:00 Location: McGill University Room: Tanna Schulich Hall Overview CIRMMT Research Axis 3: Cognition, perception and movement Presenters Michael Schutz Elizabeth Zimmerman ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"22ed0ee8ed90d7300d1938b7b10bf837","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/thu/panel-3/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/thu/panel-3/","section":"session","summary":"Thursday | 09:00 - 10:00 | Tanna Hall (McGill)","tags":["Thursday","Panel"],"title":"Panel: Research Axis 3","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Thursday Time: 10:00 - 10:45 Location: McGill University Room: Tanna Schulich Hall Speaker Sidney Fels Title “Breaking the Brain to Sound Barrier: Leveraging the Mind-Body Continuum for Musical Expression” Description Working with the idea that the mind and body form a continuum of thought to control that learns to incorporate biomechanics and environmental constraints with perceptual ones to achieve players goals, we are looking for ways to create new adaptive mechanisms for New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIMEs) that help to reduce information demands on players while at the same time increasing information throughput for more expressive interfaces.

First, I would like to focus on the impact of involving non-academic professional musicians coming from diverse cultural backgrounds in partnerships that aim at analysing their creative processes and/or designing technology that could best meet their artistic vision and social identity (Pras et al., 2021). Second, the purpose of the exchanges will be to bridge gaps between audio engineering and music technology to develop useful applications with a high level of sound quality (Bauer et al., forthcoming). Last, I will encourage attendees to learn and apply feminist and de-colonizing theories to the framework and methods of studies whose fields and disciplines are rooted in patriarchal structures (Brooks et al., 2021) and/or European concepts of modernity and innovation.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7fabf73df2cfc2de42e321f6503360c9","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/thu/interactive-session-5/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/thu/interactive-session-5/","section":"session","summary":"Thursday | 15:00 - 16:30 | McGill","tags":["Thursday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 5: EDI approaches of audio engineering and production","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Thursday Time: 15:00 - 16:30 Location: McGill University Room: C-204 Title Physiological responses to music Presenter Suresh Krishna ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cb38cab78552718a875c9425a58f9d5e","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/thu/interactive-session-6/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/thu/interactive-session-6/","section":"session","summary":"Thursday | 15:00 - 16:30 | C-204 (McGill)","tags":["Thursday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 6: Physiological responses to music","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Thursday Time: 15:00 - 16:30 Location: McGill University Room: A-832 Title Together towards a global and healthier education for musicians Presenter Isabelle Cossette ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2f4633c5b429a642bc3c7a7a065ef393","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/thu/interactive-session-7/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/thu/interactive-session-7/","section":"session","summary":"Thursday | 15:00 - 16:30 | A-832 (McGill)","tags":["Thursday","Interactive session"],"title":"Interactive Session 7: Together towards a global and healthier education for musicians","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Thursday Time: 17:00 - 17:45 Location: McGill University Room: Tanna Schulich Hall Information coming soon.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6896ed58479f1ed202b2dfcb54d0d81f","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/session/thu/round-table-2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/session/thu/round-table-2/","section":"session","summary":"Thursday | 17:00 - 17:45 | Tanna Hall (McGill)","tags":["Thursday","Round table"],"title":"Round Table 2","type":"session"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nDay: Thursday Time: 19:30 - 21:00 Location: McGill University Room: MMR Program [Joshua Bucchi]({{ relref “/author/joshua-bucchi” }}) “Shrubberies of semiconductors: Les lambeaux de mon cœur” [premiere] Performers: [Ensemble Aukio]({{ relref “/author/ensemble-aukio” }}): Anne Chabot-Bucchi (percussion), Justine Pelletier (piano), Joseph Fox (percussion), Felipe Verdugo (piano), Joshua Bucchi (electronics/diffusion) [Mélanie Frisoli]({{ relref “/author/melanie-frisoli” }}) “Le bruit I - Spatialized acousmatic work” [premiere] [Jason Noble]({{ relref “/author/jason-noble” }}) “Freeze - For augmented drum kit” [premiere] performed by: [Martin Daigle]({{ relref “/author/martin-daigle” }}) (percussion), [Edu Meneses]({{ relref “/author/edu-meneses” }}) (electronics \u0026amp;

There are several options for transportation between the airport and downtown:\npublic taxi Uber 747 express bus operated by the STM (information) Hotels shuttle (check with your hotel) Train Trains from all major Canadian cities, as well as from New York and points south, arrive at Gare Central (Central Station) in downtown Montréal. It is located on the Bonaventure station of the Orange Line subway.\nBus Bus lines to and from several regional Canadian and U.S. cities operate from Gare d’Autocars de Montréal, which connects to the Orange, Green and Yellow subway lines at the Berri-UQAM station.\nTravel within Montréal Transportation options within the city include the STM metro (subway) and bus services, public taxis, Uber, and Bixi - Montréal’s city bike rental service.\nBiki city bikes are a great way to get around Montréal in the summer. The conference will be held at two venues, McGill University and the Université de Montréal. Both are easily accessible by public transit. See the venues page for more information.\nAccommodations Hotel 10 There are a wide variety of accommodations to choose from around Montréal. Given the two venues, we suggest choosing a hotel in the downtown corridor, which is nearby McGill University, and choosing public transportation or taxi to get to the Université de Montréal.\nRecommended hotels Hotel Le Cantlie Suites Special rates are available at participating hotels as part of the McGill Guest Program. See the website for a list of hotels and instructions on how to get the preferred rate.\nIn particular, CIRMMT recommends the Cantlie Suites and Hotel 10, both of which are a short walk away from the McGill campus.\n","date":1651783550,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651783550,"objectID":"f0c10fb0daa3b8dc0c0e33e2f272daa0","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/travel/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T16:45:50-04:00","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/travel/","section":"","summary":"Table of Contents Getting to Montréal Travel within Montréal Accommodations Getting to Montréal For attendees and participants arriving from out of town, Montréal is best reached by air, train or bus.","tags":[],"title":"Transportation and Accommodation","type":"page"},{"authors":[],"categories":[""],"content":"","date":1612121460,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612121460,"objectID":"460e1b914108e2a1395e75c3ed42f513","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/concerts/","publishdate":"2021-01-31T14:31:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/concerts/","section":"","summary":"","tags":[""],"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":[],"categories":[""],"content":"","date":1612121460,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612121460,"objectID":"80788beb4f8af89fc2f21b7ff3961b08","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/sessions-by-day/","publishdate":"2021-01-31T14:31:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/sessions-by-day/","section":"","summary":"","tags":[""],"title":"Sessions","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":[],"categories":[""],"content":"","date":1612121460,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612121460,"objectID":"631361a7062b7316e9db6d25159cbbde","permalink":"https://timbre-conference.github.io/timbre2023/sessions-by-type/","publishdate":"2021-01-31T14:31:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/timbre2023/sessions-by-type/","section":"","summary":"","tags":[""],"title":"Sessions","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
